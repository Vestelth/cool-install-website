    <h1>Consciousness could be a side effect of 'entropy', say researchers</h1>
    <span>It's all connected.</span>
    <p>
      This is what many physicists believe is happening to our Universe. After the Big Bang, the Universe has gradually been moving from a state of low entropy to high entropy, and because the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy can only increase in a system, it could explain why the arrow of time only ever moves forwards.
      <br><br>
      So researchers decided to apply the same thinking to the       connections in our brains, and investigate whether they show any patterns in the way they choose to order themselves while we're conscious.
      <br><br>
      To figure this out, a team from the University of Toronto    and Paris Descartes University used a type of probability theory called statistical mechanics to model the networks of neurons in nine people's brains - including seven who had epilepsy.
